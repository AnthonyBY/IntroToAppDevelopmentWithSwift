//: ## Strings
//: Look at just about any app and you will see text. Text is everywhere, including messaging apps, news readers, social media apps and more. Even camera apps might use text to label buttons and controls.
//:
//: In most programming languages, including Swift, text values are called _strings_.
//:
//: ### Why Are They Called Strings?
//: Imagine a string of beads. Each bead may look different, but they’re all strung together in a particular order.

//: Usually a single letter (for example, an “H”) is not useful by itself. Words are made up of a whole string of letters. So programmers call text a _string_. And a string can be just about any text you can imagine.
