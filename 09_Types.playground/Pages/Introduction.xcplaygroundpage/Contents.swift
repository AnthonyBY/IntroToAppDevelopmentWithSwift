 ## Important Types
 
 In real life, using the right kind of object is very important.
 
 If you’re playing tennis, it’s important to use a ball instead of some other kind of thing, like an egg.
 
 On the other hand, having a dozen tennis balls is not very useful if you are trying to make an omelet.
 
 Different types of things have different properties and behaviors.  A tennis ball is filled with air and bounces if you drop it. An egg is filled with egg white and egg yolk and breaks if you drop it.
  
 In programming, types work in much the same way.
 
 For example, you’ve already used a type called a string to work with characters and text. Strings have properties and behaviors that are tailored for that purpose.
 
 Move on to learn more about types in Swift.
