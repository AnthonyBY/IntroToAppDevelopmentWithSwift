 ## Wrapup
 
 Every constant or variable you use in Swift has a type.
 
 For variables, the value can change, but the type canâ€™t.
 
 Types describe:
 - What a value is.
 - What a value can do.
 - Where you can use a value.
 
 Every line of code you write is checked to prevent you from using types incorrectly.
 
 Swift can infer the type of a constant or variable by the value assigned to it.
 
 To explicitly specify the type of a constant or variable, you can use type annotation.
 
 Practice what you've learned with the exercise on the next page.
