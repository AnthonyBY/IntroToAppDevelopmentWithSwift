 ## Favorite Shirt
 
 If you take a moment to imagine your favorite shirt, it’s probably not a banana. That doesn’t make sense. A banana is not a shirt.
 
 On the other hand, if you think about your favorite fruit, whether it’s a banana, an apple, or something else, it’s almost certainly some kind of fruit.
 
 When people name something — “favorite fruit” for example — the name is usually connected to a particular type of thing.
 
 The idea of “favorite fruit” only makes sense if it’s connected to a kind of fruit. It just wouldn’t make sense to connect it with  “monkey wrench” or “astronomy.” Your brain does a good job of making sure names are matched up with the correct type of thing.
 
 In a similar way, Swift keeps track of the type of value associated with constants and variables — and makes sure you don’t accidentally make a value a banana when it’s supposed to be a shirt.
 
 Next, find out about types and variables.
