//: ## Typing Names and Autocompletion
//: Xcode keeps track of all the names you’ve defined. So when you start typing, you’ll see a menu of suggested names (the names it knows about). This is called _autocompletion_.
//:
//: Autocompletion helps you write code more quickly and with fewer typing mistakes. The more you type, the more the autocompletion menu narrows down to what you’re looking for.
//:
//: Whenever the autocompletion menu appears you can:
//: - Keep typing to narrow down the list.
//: - Use the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to move up and down the list.
//: - Hit the Return key to have Xcode fill in the selected name.
//:
//: ![Autocompletion Popup Menu](autocomplete.png)
//: In the list, you’ll see names that you didn’t define. It's perfectly fine to ignore those names.
//:
//: As part of the experiment on the next page you’ll type in some names and see autocompletion in action.
