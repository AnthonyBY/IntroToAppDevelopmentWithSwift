//: ## Pet Problem
//: Imagine your friend is putting together a pet show and needs to keep track of how many animals of each kind will be in the show.
//: Your friend also needs to know how many total animals and how many mammals will be at the show.
//:
//: Now imagine that all you have with you is a laptop with Xcode on it. Maybe you can use a playground to help your friend.
//:
//: Using what you know so far, you could keep track of the count for each animal using a comment and a number, like this:
// Number Of Dogs
5

// Number Of Cats
4

// Number Of Turtles
3
//: Then you could copy those numbers onto new lines of code and let the playground do some math for you, like this:
// Total Number Of Animals
5 + 4 + 3

// Total Number Of Mammals
5 + 4
//: - experiment: As the week goes on, you get more information about what pets will be in the show.\
//:Change the code above to update the totals.
//:
//: For example, if another person is bringing a dog, change the `Number Of Dogs` from `5` to `6` and change the `5` to a `6` everywhere else it appears (`Total Number Of Animals` and `Total Number Of Mammals`).
//:
//: If someone is bringing a new kind of animal, use the same pattern as the other animal counts. Add a new comment (`// Number Of Hamsters` for example) on one line with a number on the next line. Don’t forget to update the totals.
//:
//: - Another person is bringing a dog.
//: - One of the turtles is sick and won’t be coming.
//: - Another person is bringing a cat.
//: - Someone is bringing a hamster (a mammal).
//:
//:  Could there be a better way to solve this problem? Think about it for a minute or two, then move on.
