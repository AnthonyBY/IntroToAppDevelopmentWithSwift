//: ## Pet Problem Recap
//: After you’ve made all the updates, the playground should look something like this:
// Number Of Dogs
6

// Number Of Cats
5

// Number Of Turtles
2

// Number Of Hamsters
1

// Total Number Of Animals
6 + 5 + 2 + 1

// Total Number Of Mammals
6 + 5 + 1
//: This way of using a playground definitely solved your friend’s problem. You kept track of the number of each kind of animal, the total number of animals, and the total number of mammals.
//:
//: But as you did the experiment, you might have noticed it was easy to make a mistake.  You had to change the number in multiple places. And if you forgot to update it everywhere, your totals would be wrong.
//:
//: You also had to remember which number tracked each kind of animal. Without the comment that identified each number, it’s very difficult to keep it all straight.
//:
//: One of the most useful things when writing code is being able to give something a name. Instead of repeating numbers that all refer to the same thing, you can give that thing a name — then use the name instead of the number wherever you need to in your code.
//:
//: Next you’ll find out how to do that.
