//: ## Identifiers
//: In Swift, a name is formally called an _identifier_. You will most often see the term _identifier_ used in error messages. Programmers usually use the more informal word _name_. This course will use both terms, so you can get familiar with them.
//:
//: Names for constants start with a lowercase letter. As in the examples below, they can include a few words, all run together. That‚Äôs because Swift will think each word is a different identifier if there‚Äôs a space in between.
//:
//:To make it easier to read identifiers with multiple words, every word after the first word should be capitalized. This way of writing out names is called _camel case_, because the capital letters in the middle of the name look a bit like the humps of a camel. üê´

let totalNumberOfMammals = numberOfDogs + numberOfCats + numberOfHamsters

//: - experiment: There are even more changes in the pets expected at the pet show.\
//:To add new kinds of animals, add new lines of code that define new constants. (To add a new line of code just click on a blank line in the area above and start typing.)
//:
//: Make the following additions:
//: - Someone is bringing a pot-bellied pig (a mammal)
//: - Someone is bringing a fish (not a mammal)
//: - Someone is bringing a snake (definitely not a mammal)

//: Next, learn about choosing names.
