//: Programmers use whatever tools they have available to solve all kinds of problems. (They don't have to be serious problems, sometimes a problem can be "I'm bored and want a fun game to play".)
//:
//: As you move through this course you'll learn more and more ways of getting things done, of using code to solve problems and build great apps. Things will start small and simple with some basics, but as the number of tools you have grows, you'll be able to do more and more with what you know.
//:
//: As a programmer, sometimes you solve problems and write apps for yourself but a lot of the time you help other people solve their problems. Besides learning how to write code, it's really useful to be able to imagine different kind of problems and think about how you might solve them.
//:
//: #### Pet Problem
//: Imagine your friend is putting together a pet show and needs to keep track of how many of each kind of animal people are going to be bringing.
//: Your friend also needs to keep track of how many total animals and how many mammals.
//:
//: Let's say all you have with you is a laptop with Xcode Playgrounds on it.  Maybe we can help your friend out.
//:
//: Using what we know so far, you could keep track of the count for each animal using a comment and a number like like this:

// Number Of Dogs
5

// Number Of Cats
4

// Number Of Turtles
3

//: And then you could copy those numbers down and let the Playground do some math for you, like this:

// Total Number Of Animals
5 + 4 + 3

// Total Number Of Mammals
5 + 4

//: - experiment: As the week goes on, you get more information about people's pets.  Update the code above for the changes.
//: 
//: For example, if another person is bringing a dog, keep track of the change by updating the `Number Of Dogs` from `5` to `6` and change the `5` to a `6` everywhere else it appears (`Total Number Of Animals` and `Total Number Of Mammals`).
//: 
//: If someone is bringing a new kind of animal, add a new comment (`// Number Of Hamsters` for instance) with the correct number underneath and then update the totals.
//:
//: - Another person is bringing a dog.
//: - One of the turtles got sick and won't come.
//: - Another person is bringing a cat.
//: - Someone is bringing a hamster (a mammal).
//: - Someone is bringing an iguana (definitely not a mammal).
