 ## Hello

 The `print` command tells a Swift program to send a message to the console. You can use it with a string like this:

`print("Testing, one two three.")`

 You now get to craft the first message you’ll send to the console. Most programmers, whether learning their first programming language or their fiftieth, choose to start with a friendly “hello.”
 
 But not just a generic hello. For their first hello, programmers typically go for the grander gesture and greet the whole world. This is the long-standing tradition you learned about earlier in this lesson.
 
 
 It’s time now to greet the console with a cheerful “Hello, world!” To truly participate in the ritual, you must use those two words exactly, but it’s OK to punctuate them however you’d like.

 - callout(Experiment: Hello, world):
 Type the `print` command as in the example code above, with your own “Hello, world!” greeting inside the parentheses.

// Add your greeting just below this line, and watch it appear in the console:


/*:
 Congratulations and welcome! It may seem like a lot of fuss over a single line of code, but you’re now part of a long programming tradition. Feel free to capture the moment with a selfie of yourself and the screen.
