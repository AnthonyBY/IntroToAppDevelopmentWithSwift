## Hide the Results Sidebar
 
Remember the trusty results sidebar and how it automatically shows the answers to any calculations you enter? ðŸ‘‰ */
let sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
let product = sum * sum

/*: 
 To continue in the spirit of old-time programming, youâ€™ll need to hide that sidebar. Mouse over its left edge slowly, until the cursor turns into a double-headed arrow:
 
 ![resize cursor](resize-cursor.png)
 
 Then click and drag that edge to the right until the sidebar is too small to see the whole calculation result.

   ![playgrounds results window hidden](xcode-results-hidden.png)
 
 Drag it open and shut a few times more, just so you remember how to bring it back later.
 
 - callout(Experiment):
 Change some of the numbers above. Change 5 into 23857, change 3 to 11, or to any other number. Without the results sidebar, you have to guess what the result will be.
 
 Do you miss the results sidebar? Even in this old-fashioned world, you still have a powerful tool for investigating the state of your program.

 Turn to the next page to meet the console.âœ¨
