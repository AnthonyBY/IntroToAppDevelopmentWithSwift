 ## Changing Your Colors

Many programmers like to set up their computing environment in a style that feels comfortable.  In Xcode, you can make changes to your environment by selecting Xcode > Preferences… from the menu bar:

In the Preferences window, choose the Fonts & Colors tab, and make sure Source Editor is selected:

To get a feel for a totally retro style, choose one of the three options with a dark background: Civic, Dusk or Midnight:

Did this change make the code hard to read? No problem: These are _your_ preferences, and you can make your code look however you’d like. But if you can still read the code with this dark background, stick with it for the next few playground pages—where you’ll add some other old-fashioned effects.
