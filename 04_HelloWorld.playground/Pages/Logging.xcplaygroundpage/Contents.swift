 ## Logging
 
 You may have heard of a captain’s log, where a seafaring (or spacefaring) captain records all the day-to-day info about the running of the ship. But did you know that apps can have logs, too?
 
 When coders print messages to the console, it’s usually to record, or to _log_, information about a program as it runs. Printing messages to the console is known as _logging_ and the messages are sometimes called _log messages_.
 
 Programmers often use log messages to indicate that something has gone wrong or that something unexpected has happened. As you’ll see below, messages can provide warnings and help diagnose problems.

 Once you’ve maximized your points, go ahead and hide the results sidebar. You’re going retro again.
