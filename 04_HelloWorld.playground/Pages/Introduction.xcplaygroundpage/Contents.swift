 ## The Good Old Days
 
 In this playground, you’ll participate in a special tradition that new programmers have enjoyed since the 1970s. But before you get there, you’ll need to learn a few things. It starts with how to configure your programming environment in Xcode.
 
 As you’ve gone through several projects, you might have noticed that your code looks a little different from pop culture images of code. Here’s code you’ll recognize from your work in playgrounds:

 And here’s code you might have seen on a programmer’s screen in a movie (probably an old movie):
 
 ![code sample with black background and green text](OldTimeyCode.png)
 
 Those code samples are exactly the same: They’ll run the same and have the same effects. So what’s up with the green-on-black style?
 
 It goes back to the 1970s and 1980s when computer displays were monochrome and only capable of displaying a single color, usually green on a black screen.
 
 These days, some programmers still choose a black background because it’s easier on their eyes (especially in a dark room)—or just because they like its retro look.
 
 You, of course, can use whatever color scheme helps you write the best code. Head on to the next page and follow the directions to change your Xcode color scheme.
