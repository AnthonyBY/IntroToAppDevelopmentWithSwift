 ## The Console
 
 Before touchscreen displays, mice, and trackpads, interactions with a computer were entirely text-based.

 As a programmer, you get to go behind the scenes, where youâ€™ll see and do things that typical users donâ€™t.

 One of those things is called the _console_.

 You probably know the word console in the context of video games and TV stands. In programming, though, the console is a message center that can show details about the way a program is running.

 #### Showing the Console
 Show the console by clicking this button in the bottom left of the Xcode window: ![Console Button](console_button.png)\
 or the middle button in the top right of the Xcode window: ![Hide and show panels button trio](xcode-show-debug-area.png)
 
 Show and hide the console a few times, just to practice, but leave the console showing when youâ€™re done.
 
 To adjust the height of the console, you can drag the bar at the top of the console up and down.

/*:
 Even though the code above ran, youâ€™ve received no feedback. The console is empty because it only displays messages when a programmer gives the instruction to print.
