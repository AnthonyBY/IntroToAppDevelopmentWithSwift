 ## Wrapup
 
 The console is a tool programmers use to display information about a program.
 
 You’ve learned how to show the console and how to use `print` to display all kinds of information in it.
 
 You’ve learned that the results sidebar is not available to you unless you’re in a playground, so `print` and the console is a great way to find out what’s happening when you’re building an app.
 
 And just in time, too. In the next lesson of _App Development With Swift_, you’ll get started making your first app.
 
 Continue in this playground for some exercises.
