 ## Time travel
 You've coded several projects now in Xcode, but you might have noticed that in its default mode, Xcode looks a little different from pop culture images of code.

 Code that you'd recognize from working on a playground:
   ![code sample with white background and multi-colored text](NowTimeyCode.png)
 Code that's shown on an intrepid programmer's screen, when they're hacking against the clock:
   ![code sample with black background and green text](OldTimeyCode.png)
 
 The code samples will run the same and have exactly the same effects, so why do movies and shows keep using the green-on-black style to show code?

 It all goes back to the original screens that people used for programming; [TODO: research why this actually was].

 These days, some people use the black background because it's easier on their eyes (especially in a dark room); others use it because it reminds them of these images of daring coders of yore.

 You, of course, can use whichever color schemes help you write the best code, but for this playground project, you're going to take a journey to the past. To get in the right frame of mind, head onto the next page and follow the directions to update your Xcode color scheme.

 We're headed to the past!
