//: ## What Is a Playground?
//: A playground is a place where you can play and experiment with code â€” and see instant results â€” without anything getting in your way. A playground mixes parts that explain things (like this text) with live code that you can change.
//:
//: The simplest _line of code_ you can write is just a number:
765
//:ðŸ‘†Notice how the number above looks different?
//: This style of text is *editable code*, which means you can write it or change it to make stuff happen.
//:
//: For negative numbers use the minus sign:
-1200
/*:
Notice how the numbers also show up in the gray area to the right? ðŸ‘‰

That area is called the _results sidebar_. As you add or change code, the playground runs your code again and updates the results in the sidebar.
 
- experiment:
    - Click a line of code to move the cursor there.
    - Type to start editing code.
    - Change the numbers a few times.
    - Add a few new numbers, each on a separate line.\
Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.

Next, find out how to put the results sidebar to better use.
