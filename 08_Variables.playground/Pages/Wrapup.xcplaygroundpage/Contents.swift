 ## Wrapup
 
 You’ve learned some very important concepts in this playground:
 
 - Values declared with `let` are constants, and can’t be changed once a value is assigned. These values are called _immutable_.
 - Values declared with `var` are variables, and can be assigned new values over time. These values are called _mutable_.
 - A mutable value can be used as part of an assignment statement to itself: `score = score + 10`.
 - Compound assignment operators allow mutable values to be updated: `score += 10`.
 - Using constants and variables in the correct places helps make your code safer and easier to understand.
 
 Practice what you’ve learned with the upcoming exercises.
