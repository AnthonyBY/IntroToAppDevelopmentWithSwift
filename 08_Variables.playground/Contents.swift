 ## Constants
 
 Up to this point every time you have named a value, you have done it like this:
 ```
 let name = "Johnny"
 ```
 
 Once this is done, `name` is _always_ “Johnny”.
*/
let name = "Johnny"
//name = "John"
//: - experiment: Uncomment the line above, which tries to give a new value to `name`. What error do you see?
/*:
 Values that can't be changed are called **constants**, because the value of them is constant. When you use `let` to declare a value, you are saying that the value will never change.
 
 That is often very useful. Sometimes you don’t want values to change, or to change them accidentally. But sometimes you _do_ want to be able to change things. Then, you need **variables**, not constants.
