 ## Wrapup
 
 In this playground you’ve learned about the concept of an API, a set of functions provided by another developer to help you work.
 
 Once you’ve learned the basics of programming, you’ll learn a lot more about about working with APIs.
 
 You’ve also had more practice with using and defining functions and using functions to group repeated work together.
 
 Dance routines are all about performing a preplanned sequence of moves in repeating patterns, so functions made up of functions (made up of functions, and so on…) are perfect for making great dances!
 
 At the end of the lesson, you signed your work and made some fun GIFs to share with your friends.
 
 The next few pages are blank BoogieBots, so you can create a few routines and GIFs without overwriting your work. Now’s your chance to do some interesting things with groups of functions. Give it a try.
