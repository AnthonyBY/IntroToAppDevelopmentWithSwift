 ## BoogieBot
 
 In this playground you’ll get to know BoogieBot, a dancing robot.
 
 You’ll use your knowledge of functions to make BoogieBot dance by calling existing functions. Then you’ll define functions of your own to create dance routines.
 
 Finally you’ll add a text title, have a chance to sign your work and save it as an animated image like the one below:
