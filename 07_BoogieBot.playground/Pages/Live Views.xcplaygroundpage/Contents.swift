 ## Live Views
 
 Live views are a playground feature that let you see instant updates to your work, without having to add inline results as you did in the Strings playground. Live views also allow you to play with animation.

 The assistant editor should be showing the playground‚Äôs timeline. If it isn't, click the first entry in the bar at the top and choose ‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù so it looks like this:
