 ## Algorithms
 
 During this lesson you’ve been creating different dance routines for BoogieBot by combining moves into functions. Computer scientists would say that you’ve spent this lesson developing _algorithms_.
 
When you develop an algorithm, you’re defining a series of steps to be performed. They don’t have to be dance steps, of course; any self-contained step-by-step series of operations is an algorithm.
 
Defining algorithms is a large part of programming. There are complex mathematical algorithms that do things like compress video so it can be sent efficiently over the Internet. There are algorithms that don’t involve mathematics at all, like an algorithm to check if an app user has any new messages and to present a notification if they do. And, of course, algorithms for getting software robots to dance.
 
 Next, get an overview of what you’ve learned.
