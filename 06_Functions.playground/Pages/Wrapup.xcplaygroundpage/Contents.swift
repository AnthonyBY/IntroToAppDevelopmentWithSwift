 ## Wrapup
 
 You’ve now seen how functions can be used to group code together so that a complicated task can be performed with a single line of code, even if that line of code relies on many lines written somewhere else.
 
 You’ve also seen that using a function instead of writing out code over again can make changes easier. If you decide to change how a program works, you may only need to change it in one place.
 
 Finally, you‘ve seen how functions are a powerful example of abstraction.
