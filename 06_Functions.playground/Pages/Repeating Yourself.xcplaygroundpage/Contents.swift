 ## Repeating Yourself
 
 You’ve looked at a lot of playgrounds by now. On each page the code runs from top to bottom, and you see the outcome in the results sidebar.
 
 You’ve also learned how to print to the console. The following code is going to print a nursery rhyme. Open the console to read it.

print("Row, row, row your boat")
print("Gently down the stream")
print("Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily")
print("Life is but a dream")
print("        ~        ")
print("Row, row, row your boat")
print("Gently down the stream")
print("If you see a crocodile")
print("Don't forget to scream")
print("        ~        ")
print("Row, row, row your boat")
print("Gently down the stream")
print("This song is quite repetitive")
print("Can you spot the theme")

 There are two things that programmers try to avoid:
 - Repeating themselves
 - Repeating themselves
 
 Writing the same code more than once gives you more things to write, to understand and to fix. 
 
 How many of the lines of code above are repeated? How can you fix this? Find out on the next page.
