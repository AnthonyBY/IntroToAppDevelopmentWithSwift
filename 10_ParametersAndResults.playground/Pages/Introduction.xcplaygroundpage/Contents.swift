/*:
 ## Functions, Revisited
 
 When you learned about functions, you called them like this:
 ```
 doSomething()
 ```
 You may have noticed that you were also calling a function in a slightly different way:
 ```
 print("Hello, world!")
 ```
 For the function `print()` to work, it has to have a value inside the parentheses. Without being able to pass in that value, `print()` wouldnâ€™t know what to print and would be pretty useless.
 
 Next, learn about passing values into your own functions.
