 ## Wrapup
 
 In this lesson you’ve learned to supercharge your functions by letting them take in information, do things with it, and pass information out.
 
 You've learned that functions should read like sentences when you call them. You'll achieve this by carefully choosing names for your parameters and functions.
 
 Like all computer programs, apps are built up from many functions, passing information back and forth and working with it. You now have the power to make these important building blocks.
 
 Practice what you’ve learned with the exercises.
