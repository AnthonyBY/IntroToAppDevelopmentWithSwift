/*:
 ## Your Favorite Food
 
 The following code prints the value of a constant to the console:
 ```
 let favoriteFood = "cheese"
 print("My favorite food is " + favoriteFood)
 ```

 - callout(Exercise): Put the print statement above inside a function that allows you to pass in any string as an argument. When you call the function, it should look like this:\
 `printFavorite(food: "cheese")`\
 _Hint: You can go back to the previous page to check on how to define a function with a parameter._
