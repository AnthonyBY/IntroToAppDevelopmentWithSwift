/*:
 ## Wrapup
 
Every app has a model that represents the data it uses.
 
You can define your own types in Swift to organize data in a way that makes sense for your app.
 
One way to create custom types is by defining structs.

A struct is a type that can group together properties and methods.
 
Some properties hold data, like variables or constants. Others return a calculated value.

You create and use instances of your custom types the same way as any other type in Swift.
 
You use your custom types like any other types, including as function parameters and return types.

Next, design and build some structs of your own.
