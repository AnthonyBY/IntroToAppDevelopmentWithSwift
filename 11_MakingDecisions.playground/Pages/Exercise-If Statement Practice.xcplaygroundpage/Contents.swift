 ## Exercise: If Statement Practice
 
 Come to grips with the if statement by rewriting the following comments in code form.
*/
let a = 20
let b = 30
let c = 20

// If a is equal to c, print "a and c are the same"



// If a is less than b, print "b is ahead of a"



// If b is greater than a, print "a is not winning against b"



// If a is less than or equal to c, print "a is either losing to or tied with c"



//: - callout(Exercise): Add code after each comment above to follow the instructions. (For the greater than and less than operators, remember the rule about the hungry mouth.)
