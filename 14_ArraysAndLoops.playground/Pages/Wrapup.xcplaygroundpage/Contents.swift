 ## Wrapup
 
 You can use arrays to hold lists of items. Arrays have two key features:
 
 - The items in the array are all of the same type.
 - The items in the array are in a specific order.
 
 Because of these two features, you can access items from specific points in the array using the index, and you’ll always get back a value of a known type.
 
 Here are some other things you’ve learned about arrays:
 
 - The first index of an array is zero, not one.
 - Accessing arrays using the index can be dangerous. If the index used is outside the bounds of the array, your program will crash.
 - You can find out the number of items in an array using the `count` property.
 - You can use `for…in` loops to safely access each item in the array in order, without needing to know how many items the array contains.
 - Mutable arrays allow you to add, remove, and replace items.
 
 Practice what you’ve learned with the exercises.
