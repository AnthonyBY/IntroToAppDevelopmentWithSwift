 ## Lists
 
 When you learned about Strings, you did some exercises that dealt with lists of things. You made these lists by joining multiple strings together with the `\n` newline character. 
 
 ```
 let shoppingList = "Eggs" + "\n" + "Tomatoes" + "\n" + ...
 ```
 
 This gives you a list that you can read out nicely on the screen, but it doesn't give you much else. Think of the other things you might want to do with a list:
 
 - What's the first thing? The last thing? The 24th thing? 
 - How many things are there?
 - How can I rearrange the list?
 - What if my list isn't made of `String` values, but something else?
 
 There is a special Type called an **Array**, which is used to hold a list of items. In this playground you will learn about creating and working with Arrays.
