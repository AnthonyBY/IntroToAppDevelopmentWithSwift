 ## Wrapup
 
 Enumerations are used when you want to represent one of a group of related values. Each possible value is called a case.
 
 When you create an enum, you’re making a new type. Instances of that type can only have values matching one of the specified cases.
 
 Using enums can make your code easier to read and write, because it’s always clear what the possible values are and what they mean.
 
 You can compare enum values with `==`, or use a switch statement to test for all possible values.
 
 Like if statements, switch statements are another way of making decisions in your code. Switch statements work very well with enums, but can be used to switch on any type of value.
 
 Because switch statements must be exhaustive, you must handle every possible value. To handle any values that haven’t been specified, you can use a default case. 
 
 Like structs, you can add calculated properties and methods to enums.
 
 Practice what you’ve learned with the exercises.
