 ## Exercise: Replacing Bools
 
 The following struct describes a type of enemy in a game:
*/

struct Enemy {
    let strength: Int
    let speed: Int
    let weapon: Bool
}
/*: 
 As your game has developed, youâ€™ve decided that your enemies might have more than one type of weapon.
 
 - callout(Exercise): Define an enum to represent the weapons an enemy might have: `none`, `sword`, `rubberMallet` and so on. Change the struct definition to use your new enum instead of a `Bool`.
