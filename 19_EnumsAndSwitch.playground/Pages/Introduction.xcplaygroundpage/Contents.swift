 ## Multiple Choice
 
 You’re often given choices to make in life. In many cases, you must pick one of a set of options, and picking nothing isn’t a choice.
 
 For example, in the school cafeteria on a given day, the lunch options might be pasta, a burger, or soup. The cafeteria staff are in no mood for you to mix and match, so you must make a choice.
 
 Pick one. 
 
 This system works well for the cafeteria, and for the school:
 
 - The staff know that they’ll only need to provide one of three meals.
 - The staff can prepare and serve each meal quickly and efficiently.
 - No time is wasted understanding or taking down special orders.
 - The school knows that everyone has had a nutritious lunch and will be energized for an afternoon of learning.
 
 As a programmer you can benefit from applying these same kinds of controlled choices in your programs.
