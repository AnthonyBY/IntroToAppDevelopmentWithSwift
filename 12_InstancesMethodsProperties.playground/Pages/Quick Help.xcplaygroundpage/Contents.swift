 ## Quick Help
 
 In addition to the popover that appears when you Option-click in Xcode, you can find the same information using the Quick Help inspector.
 
 To view this, make sure the utilities area is visible, by choosing View > Utilities > Show Quick Help Inspector from the menu.
 
 Wherever your cursor is positioned, the Quick Help inspector will tell you about the code at that point.
*/
let example = "It was the best of times"
example.hasPrefix("It was")
/*: 
 For example, when the cursor is placed anywhere in the `hasPrefix` text, the inspector will show the methodâ€™s definition:
 
 ![Quick Help for hasPrefix method](QuickHelp.png)
 
 - callout(Exercise): Move the cursor around inside the code above and look at the Quick Help inspector. Where does it tell you useful things? Where does it not give you any help at all?

 Next learn where all of this information comes from.
