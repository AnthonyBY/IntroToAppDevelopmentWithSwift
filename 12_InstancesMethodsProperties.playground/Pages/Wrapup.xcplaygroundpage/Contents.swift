 ## Wrapup
 
 In this lesson you’ve learned that each value of a particular type is called an instance.
 
 You’ve also learned that types aren't just a label like `String` or `Int`, but that each type can have additional capabilities.
 
 Types can have properties, which allow each instance to have its own set of values.
 
 Types can have instance methods, which are functions defined as part of a type.
 
 You can find out about the methods and properties available using the documentation that’s built in to Xcode. Documentation can be accessed directly from code by Option-clicking the code or using the Quick Help inspector. Or you can launch the documentation browser in its own window and look up whatever interests you.
 
 You’ve seen that even a seemingly simple type like `String` has a large number of methods and properties.
 
 You’ve read why it makes sense to provide things as instance methods and properties rather than functions defined at the top level.
 
 Now, it’s time to practice with the exercises.
