 ## Read the Fine Manual
 
 The popover and the Quick Help inspector all get their information from the same source: the documentation supplied for that particular API.
 
 You can access the full documentation using the links at the bottom of the popover or the Quick Help inspector:
 
 ![Documentation Link](LinkToDocs.png)
 
 You can also access the documentation directly using Window > “Documentation and API Reference” from the Xcode menu. This opens a separate window with the documentation viewer.
 
 - callout(Exercise): Open the documentation viewer as instructed above and search for `String` using the search bar at the top of the window. Look at some of the documentation for the `String` type.
 
 _The search results should look like this, select the first item to see the documentation for the `String` API:_

 > The documentation covers _everything_, which can make it seem very complicated. You’re not expected to read, understand or remember all of it, any more than you would read, understand and remember all of Wikipedia. It exists to give you the information you need, when you need it.
 
 Next, learn about the two ways you will most often see types declared in the documentation.
